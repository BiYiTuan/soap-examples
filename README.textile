h1. This a really simple and basic example of a Greeting Web Service implemented using Play! Framework features.

* Included, the WSDL and it is exposed as such
* EndPoint URL can be used by SOAPUI for testing (http://localhost:9000/services/MyService.wsdl)

BasicTest show request/response and enveloppes
* Can be used to see exactly what's happening

bc. IMPORTANT: The thread pool must be greater than 2 => 
Hope this will help Claw ;-)
